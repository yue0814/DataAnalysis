Analyzing data is a core skill for many scientists. In addition to familiarity with probability and statistics, good data analysis requires skill in computing, data management, effective presentation of results and communication with scientific colleagues. The data analyst must be able to translate the scientific question and hypothesis into a testable form, advise about data to be collected, manipulate the data into a computable format and carry out computations to fit, test and check models.

Here we could be analyzing data with scientific colleagues and who want to develop a practical hands-on toolkit and gain experience in distilling complex statistical information into formats understandable to colleagues. Topics including data collection and management, exploratory data analysis, fitting and checking models, simulation, predictive models, handling missing data and presentation of reproducible results will be developed through a series of case studies based on different types of data requiring a variety of statistical methods. Statistical programming techniques including functions, graphs and tables will be emphasized.
